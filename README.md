# Code Institute: Python Project by Rafaela Wetzel

The third milestone project is about creating a Python command-line application and showcasing the Python skills I have attained over the past 5 weeks at Code Institute. It is deployed on a Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku and the third out of five projects.
